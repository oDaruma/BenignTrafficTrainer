# Label_Trainer — Intrusion Detection Model Pipeline

## Non‑technical explanation
This project trains a machine‑learning model to spot suspicious network activity (like lateral movement or zero‑day‑style behavior) from flow/payload statistics. We feed past examples of **benign** vs **attack** traffic to the model so it can learn patterns, then set a **decision threshold (τ)** that balances catching more true attacks with keeping false alarms low for SOC analysts.

## Data
- Original dateset obtained from `UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017 Labelled PCAP Data` (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasiralifarrukh/unsw-and-cicids2017-labelled-pcap-data/code/data)
- Source file expected at: `archive/Payload_data_UNSW.csv` (tabular flow/payload features with binary labels).
- Features are aggregated statistics per flow/session; no raw packet contents or personal identifiers are included.
- Train/validation/test splits are **stratified** to preserve class balance. Intermediate splits and artifacts are stored under `staging/` for reproducibility.

## Model
- **Primary:** LightGBM classifier (gradient‑boosted trees) chosen for strong tabular performance, speed, and native handling of non‑linear interactions.
- **Secondary (optional):** CNN baseline for derived representations.
- **Decision rule:** predict attack when \( $\hat p \ge \tau$ \); **τ** is chosen to **maximize F1** on the validation set.

## Hyperparameter optimisation
- **Manual grid (parallel):** Exploratory search with `joblib.Parallel` (multi‑threaded).
- **Bayesian optimization:** `skopt` (BayesSearchCV / ask‑tell) with checkpointing and resume.
- Global concurrency via `N_THREADS`; models set `n_jobs=-1` when supported.
